abstract: >
  A novel two-layer architecture combining Transient Scaffolding Networks (TSN)
  for structural plasticity and memory management with an Emergent Coalition
  Architecture (ECA) for dynamic concept grouping and context-aware routing.
  Achieves 44% average latency reduction over standard LLM agent cold-starts
  while reducing memory footprint by 96% versus full LLM deployments.
  Formally proven across 9 theorems and 1 corollary.
