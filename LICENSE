1. DEFINITIONS

"Documentation" refers to all written content in this repository, including
but not limited to: the whitepaper, mathematical formalizations, theorems,
proofs, architectural specifications, diagrams, benchmarks, pseudocode, and
the CITATION.cff file.

"Implementation" refers to any software, source code, compiled binary,
firmware, script, or system that realizes, approximates, or is derived from
the architectural patterns, algorithms, or mathematical specifications
described in this Documentation.

"Core Architecture" refers specifically to: the Topological Semantic Network
(TSN), the Emergent Coalition Assembler (ECA), the CAFCA process, the
Contextual Resonance Gate, the Offline Graph Consolidation (OGC) mechanism,
Anticipatory Cascade Routing (ACR), and all associated stability theorems
and mathematical corollaries described herein.

"Derivative Work" means any work — whether research, software, product,
model, or service — that is substantially based on, inspired by, reproduces,
or extends the Core Architecture or any material portion of this
Documentation.

"Commercial Use" means any use — direct or indirect — intended for or
resulting in commercial advantage, monetary compensation, or integration into

license to:

  (a) READ and ACCESS this Documentation for personal study, academic
      research, or evaluation purposes;

  (b) CITE this work in academic publications, research papers, or
      presentations, provided that proper attribution is given in accordance
      with Section 4 of this License;

  (c) REFERENCE the high-level architectural concepts in academic writing,
      provided no reproduction of the mathematical specifications, theorems,

3. RESTRICTIONS

The following are expressly PROHIBITED without prior explicit written
permission from the Author:

  3.1 IMPLEMENTATION
      You may not implement, develop, build, or deploy any software system,
      agent framework, orchestration layer, or AI product that reproduces,
      approximates, or is substantially derived from the Core Architecture
      or any component thereof.

  3.2 COMMERCIAL USE
      You may not use this Documentation or any portion of the Core
      Architecture for any Commercial Use, including: building competing
      products, white-labelling, integrating into proprietary or open-source
      agent frameworks, or selling derivative architectures.

  3.3 AI AND MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING
      You may not use this Documentation, in whole or in part, as training
      data, fine-tuning data, RLHF data, preference data, or in any other
      capacity to train, fine-tune, distill, align, or improve any machine
      learning model, large language model, neural network, or AI system.

  3.4 REVERSE ENGINEERING
      You may not use this Documentation to reverse-engineer, reconstruct,
      or approximate the proprietary Implementation. The mathematical
      specifications are published to establish priority of invention and
      enable peer verification — not to enable replication.

  3.5 REDISTRIBUTION
      You may not redistribute, republish, mirror, or archive this
      Documentation or any substantial portion thereof on any platform,
      database, or repository without the Author's explicit written consent.

  3.6 DERIVATIVE WORKS
      You may not create Derivative Works based on the Core Architecture
      without a separate written license agreement with the Author.

  3.7 PRIOR ART NOTICE
      This public disclosure constitutes documented prior art as of
      February 27, 2026. Any patent application filed by a third party
      that covers methods, systems, or architectures substantially identical
      to or derived from the Core Architecture described in this
      Documentation is subject to prior art invalidation based on this
      publication. The Author reserves the right to contest such
      applications in any jurisdiction.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
